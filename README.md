# Object-Oriented-Terminology

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is where you ensure sensitive data is hidden from the user by declaring class variables as private and creating public get&set methods that can access / update the private variables without security concerns.

## Abstraction

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism refers to having methods with the same name and parameter types exhibit different behaviour depending on the receiver, allowing you to send the same message to two different objects and have them respond in different ways.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is where you define a new class / object and have it inherit characteristics from a parent class avoiding code being rewritten. An example of this would be, Having a parent class called 'Vehicle' and a child class called 'Car' or 'Truck', inheriting characteristics such as fuel type etc. Multiple Inheritance allows the parent class to have as many child classes as you'd need.
